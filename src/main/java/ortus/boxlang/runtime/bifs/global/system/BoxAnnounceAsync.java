	 * Announce a BoxLang event to the global system interceptor service asynchronously. By default, the event is announced to the global interception service.
	 * The return value is a BoxLang CompletableFuture that will be completed when the event has been announced.
	 * Available pools are "global" and "request".
	 * The request pool is tied to the application listener and is only available during the request lifecycle.
	 *
	 * Example:
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * // Announce globally
	 * var future = announceAsync( "onRequestStart", { request = request } )
	 *
	 * // Announce to the application request
	 * var future = announceAsync( "myRequestEvent", { data : myData }, "request" )
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * @param context   The context in which the BIF is being invoked.
	 * @param arguments Argument scope for the BIF.
	 *
	 * @argument.state The interceptor event to announce: Ex: "onRequestStart", "onRequestEnd", "onError"
	 *
	 * @argument.data The data struct to send with the event
	 *
	 * @argument.poolname The name of the interceptor pool to announce the event to. Default is "global". Available pools are "global" and "request".
	 *
	 * @return A CompletableFuture that will be completed when the event has been announced, or null if the state doesn't exist
