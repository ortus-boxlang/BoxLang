# Lexical Elements: Errors

Throwing custom errors in BoxLang is a powerful feature that allows developers to handle exceptional situations in their code. By creating and throwing custom errors, developers can provide more specific and meaningful error information, which can be crucial for debugging and maintaining the application.

In BoxLang, you can throw a custom error using the `bx:throw` component or the `throw` function. Both allow you to specify the type of the error, a message describing the error, and additional custom information.

Here's an example of throwing a custom error with the `bx:throw` component:

```BoxLang
<bx:throw type="MyCustomError" message="Something went wrong" detail="More details about the error">
```

And here's how you can do it with the `throw` function:

```BoxLang
throw(type="MyCustomError", message="Something went wrong", detail="More details about the error");
```

The `type` attribute is used to categorize the error. This can be any string, but it's common to use a descriptive name that indicates the nature of the error. The `message` attribute is a brief description of the error, and the `detail` attribute can be used to provide more detailed information.

When you throw a custom error, it can be caught and handled using the `bx:catch` component or the `catch` block in a `try/catch` statement. The caught error object will contain the type, message, and detail that you specified when throwing the error, along with other information about the error.

Here's an example of catching a custom error with the `bx:catch` component:

```BoxLang
<bx:try>
    <!--- Some code that might throw an error --->
    <bx:throw type="MyCustomError" message="Something went wrong" detail="More details about the error">
    <bx:catch type="MyCustomError" variable="e">
        <!--- Handle the error --->
        <bx:output>Error: #e.message# (#bx:e.detail#)</bx:output>
    </bx:catch>
</bx:try>
```

And here's how you can use this in script/classes with a `try/catch` statement:

```BoxLang
try {
    // Some code that might throw an error
    throw(type="MyCustomError", message="Something went wrong", detail="More details about the error");
} catch (any e) {
    if (e.type == "MyCustomError") {
        // Handle the error
        writeOutput("Error: " & e.message & " (" & e.detail & ")");
    }
}
```

Throwing custom errors is particularly useful when you're writing a function or a component that can be used by other parts of your application or by other developers. By throwing a custom error when something goes wrong, you can communicate exactly what the problem is, making it easier for the calling code to handle the error appropriately.

In conclusion, throwing custom errors in BoxLang is a powerful technique for handling exceptional situations in your code. It allows you to provide specific, meaningful error information, which can be crucial for debugging and maintaining your application. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced BoxLang developer, understanding how to throw and catch custom errors is an important skill.
