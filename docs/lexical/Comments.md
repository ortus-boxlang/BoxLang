# Comments

Lexical comments in BoxLang are an integral part of the language's syntax, serving as a tool for developers to annotate and explain their code. These comments are not processed by the BoxLang interpreter, meaning they do not affect the execution of the code, but they provide valuable context and explanation for human readers.

In BoxLang, there are two primary types of lexical comments: single-line comments and multi-line comments.

Single-line comments in BoxLang start with two forward slashes `//`. Everything following these slashes on the same line is considered part of the comment and is ignored by the BoxLang interpreter. For instance:

```
// This is a single-line comment in BoxLang
```

BoxLang
Multi-line comments, on the other hand, are enclosed between `/*` and `*/`. Everything within these symbols is considered part of the comment, regardless of how many lines it spans. For example:

```
/*
* This is a multi-line comment in BoxLang.
* It can span multiple lines.
*/
```

Lexical comments are not only for human readers. They can also be utilized by various tools to generate documentation, enforce coding standards, or even guide the behavior of the BoxLang interpreter in certain cases.

For instance, BoxLang supports a special type of comment known as a "hint". Hints are written as comments but are read by the BoxLang interpreter and used to provide additional information about the code. For example, you can use a hint to provide a description of a function:

```
/**
 * @hint This function calculates the sum of two numbers.
 */
function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

In this example, the @hint annotation in the comment provides a description of the sum function. This description can be read by tools that generate documentation, or by the BoxLang interpreter itself to provide more informative error messages.

Lexical comments in BoxLang also play a crucial role in code organization and readability. By providing clear, concise explanations of complex code blocks, developers can ensure that their code is easily understandable by others, including their future selves. This is particularly important in large projects or when working in a team, where understanding others' code quickly is often necessary.

Moreover, lexical comments can be used to temporarily disable sections of code during debugging or development. By commenting out a section of code, developers can isolate problem areas or prevent execution of certain code blocks without deleting them.

In conclusion, lexical comments in BoxLang are a powerful tool for improving the readability, maintainability, and usability of your code. They allow you to annotate your code with useful information, and can even influence the behavior of the BoxLang interpreter in some cases. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced BoxLang developer, understanding and utilizing comments effectively is a valuable skill.
