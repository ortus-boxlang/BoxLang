#BoxLang Runtime

The BoxLang runtime is designed with a lightweight core, ensuring minimal resource usage and fast startup times. It is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of modules that provide additional functionality.

Addtional runtime modules provide additional functionality, and can be extended as the necessity for new runtimes emerge and evolve:

* **Web Runtime**: This module provides the necessary tools and libraries for building and running web applications. It includes support for HTTP and WebSocket protocols, HTML templating, and session management. It's designed to be efficient and scalable, capable of handling thousands of simultaneous connections.

* **AWS Lambda** runtime: This module allows the language to be used for serverless computing on the AWS platform. It provides an interface between the AWS Lambda service and the language, handling the details of receiving and responding to AWS Lambda events. This allows developers to focus on writing their application logic, without needing to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

* **Web Assembly (WASM)**:  This module is scheduled for near-term development and will compile the language to WebAssembly, a binary instruction format designed to be fast and efficient for browsers to load and execute. This allows the language to be used for client-side web development, opening up new possibilities for high-performance web applications.

These modules are just examples of what is possible for leveraging the power BoxLang. The modular nature of the runtime means that new runtimes can be added as needed, providing support for new platforms or technologies. This makes the language highly versatile and future-proof.

The core runtime is designed with developer productivity in mind. It includes features such as hot code reloading, which allows changes to be reflected immediately without needing to restart the application. It also includes a comprehensive standard library of functions and components, providing a wide range of functionality, for most use cases, out of the box.

BoxLang is designed to be lightweight, modular, and designed for modern technology needs. It provides a solid foundation for building a wide range of applications, from small personal projects to large-scale enterprise systems.
