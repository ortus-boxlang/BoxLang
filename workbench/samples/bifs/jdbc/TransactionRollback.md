### Using TransactionRollback with TransactionCommit

This simple example shows two JDBC queries executed inside a transaction. The first query, an INSERT, is committed to the database while the second is rolled back.

```java
transaction {
    queryExecute( "INSERT INTO vehicles (id,make) VALUES (8, 'Ford' )", {}, { datasource : "carDB" } );
    transactionCommit();

    queryExecute( "UPDATE developers SET name = 'Chevrolet' WHERE id=8", {}, { datasource : "carDB" } );
    transactionRollback();
}
```

Note that the rollback cannot affect the INSERT statement, since it has already been committed ("persisted") to the database.

#### Using TransactionRollback with TransactionSetSavepoint

Many times, you may wish to roll back only a portion of a transaction. This is possible by setting a "savepoint" upon the transaction:

```java
transaction {
    queryExecute( "INSERT INTO vehicles (id,make) VALUES (8, 'Ford' )", {}, { datasource : "carDB" } );
    transactionSetSavepoint( 'insert' );

    queryExecute( "UPDATE developers SET name = 'Chevrolet' WHERE id=8", {}, { datasource : "carDB" } );
    transactionRollback( 'insert' );
}
```

Multiple savepoints can be set or referenced.
