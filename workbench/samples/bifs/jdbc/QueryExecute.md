### Simple Example

SQL only example. Assumes that a default datasource has been specified (by setting the variable `this.datasource` in Application.bx).

```java
qryResult = queryExecute("SELECT * FROM Employees");
```

### Using Named Placeholders

Use `:structKeyName` in your sql along with a struct of key/value pairs:

```java
qryResult = queryExecute(
  "SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE empid = :empid AND country = :country", 
  {
    country="USA", 
    empid=1
  }
);
```

### Using Positional Placeholders

You can pass placeholders by position using an array of parameters and the question mark `?` symbol:

```java
qryResult = queryExecute(
  "SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE empid = ? AND country = ?", 
  [
    1,
    "USA"
  ]
);
```
