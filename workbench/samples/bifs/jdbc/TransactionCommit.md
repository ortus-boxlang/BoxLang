### Using TransactionCommit with TransactionRollback

This simple example shows two JDBC queries executed inside a transaction. The first query, an INSERT, is committed to the database while the second is rolled back.

```java
transaction {
    queryExecute( "INSERT INTO vehicles (id,make) VALUES (8, 'Ford' )", {}, { datasource : "carDB" } );
    transactionCommit();

    queryExecute( "UPDATE developers SET name = 'Chevrolet' WHERE id=8", {}, { datasource : "carDB" } );
    transactionRollback();
}
```

Note that the rollback cannot affect the INSERT statement, since it has already been committed ("persisted") to the database.
